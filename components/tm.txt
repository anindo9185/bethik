Scrap the whole idea. I need to redo the text selection component again. This time, make every word and puncuation character selectable. If I click on it, it will show on the dualdivs component. 

Constrains: 
1. "This is a banana"
    I can click on "this", "is" like that. Sequencial. But I cannot select "this" , "banana" while skipping "is", "a"

2. Once I've selected and corrected it, I want to show the corrected output to the user. After correcting one, I cannot select overlapping words.
    Example: "This is aban ana". If I select "aban", "ana" and correct it, Then I can't select "is", "aban". 

3. Store evrey words and their corresponding corrected word with the indexes
